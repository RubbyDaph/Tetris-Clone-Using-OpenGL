# Tetris Clone Using OpenGL

I decided to make a clone of a Tetris in educational purposes.

Before last commit there was no collision for blocks, only collision with borders of the screen.

## Check List

- [x] Collision For Blocks
- [ ] Deleting Lines When The Line Is Full
- [ ] Score System
- [ ] Block Hold system

## Dependencies

App is built with:
- MinGW
- SDL2-devel-2.32.8-mingw
- OpenGL 3.3
- Dear ImGui [Official Repo](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)
