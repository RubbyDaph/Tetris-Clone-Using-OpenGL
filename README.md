# Tetris Clone Using OpenGL

I decided to make a clone of a Tetris in educational purposes.

Before last commit there was no collision for blocks, only collision with borders of the screen.

## Check List

[x] Collision For Blocks
[ ] Deleting Lines When The Line Is Full
[ ] Score System
[ ] Block Hold system
